<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a PhD candidate with Prof. Christian Holz at the <a href="https://siplab.org/">SIPLAB</a> at ETH Zurich, specializing in <b>camera-based and wearable physiological sensing for health applications and intelligent computer agents</b>. My primary research goal is to advance current healthcare systems and intelligent computer agents by leveraging a person's remotely estimated physiological state, derived solely from video data. Using a person's physiological state, I aim to enhance understanding of their behavior, intent, and health to, for example, improve the quality of personalized assistance. <br/><br/>
During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on recording multimodal datasets comprising synchronized video recordings and physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and electrodermal activity (EDA). Currently, I am developing novel signal processing and deep learning techniques to estimate these physiological signals from facial videos, for example, using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). Ultimately, I aim to improve health solutions and intelligent computer agents using these signals. <br/> </div>
