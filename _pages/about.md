I am a PhD candidate with Professor Christian Holz at the [Sensing, Interaction & Perception Lab](https://siplab.org/) at ETH Zurich, specializing in camera-based and wearable physiological sensing for healthcare and affective computing applications. My primary research goal is to advance current healthcare systems and intelligent computer agents by leveraging a person's remotely estimated physiological state, derived solely from video data. Using a person's physiological state, I aim to enhance understanding of their behavior, intent, and health to, for example, improve the quality of personalized assistance. \ \
During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on recording multimodal datasets comprising synchronized video recordings and physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Currently, I am developing novel signal processing and deep learning techniques to estimate these physiological signals from facial videos. Ultimately, I aim to improve healthcare solutions and intelligent computer agents using these signals.
